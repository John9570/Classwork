# Classwork

This is a repository of the class projects I did in ECE 3574, Applied Software Design.

HW1 is a simple calendar billing program, it uses a .dat file to save names and dates and times to a file for "billing"
purposes. 

HW2 is a Dictionary project, it uses the build in Dictionary in Ubuntu to analyze a user inputted text file for spelling errors
and word counts (correct words and misspelled).

HW3 is the same implementation of HW2, but it includes a GUI for much easier interfacing. 

HW4 is a GUI based simulator for a very simple computer, it reads a program file and includes buttons to allow a user to 
step through instructions and see what happens to data memory.
